## About me
I am at the beginning of my path to being a manual software tester. I have been interested in software testing for several months. I devote my free time to intensive learning of theories, technologies, and related issues. So far, I've been learning on my own from Udemy courses, books, blogs, etc. I am currently gaining valuable experience in a training and internship project, after which I will be looking for employment as a junior manual software tester. In the future, I want to develop towards test automation.
